## Lunar Rhythm and Consciousness

The Moon's waxing and waning directly influences our mental and emotional states. By aligning meditation practices with lunar phases, we can work with cosmic rhythms rather than against them.

## Phase-by-Phase Practice

### New Moon (Amavasya)
- **Focus**: New beginnings, setting intentions
- **Practice**: Silence meditation, intention setting

### Full Moon (Purnima)
- **Focus**: Culmination, illumination
- **Practice**: Chakra meditation, gratitude practice

## Simple Daily Practice

Align your daily sadhana:
- Morning: Solar practices (Surya Namaskar)
- Evening: Lunar practices (Chandra meditation)

*Note: Consistency matters more than duration.*
