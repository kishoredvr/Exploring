## The Cosmic Significance

In Vedic astrology, a lunar eclipse (Chandra Grahan) is more than just an astronomical event. It's a powerful spiritual moment when the Earth's shadow temporarily obscures the Moon, symbolizing the temporary veiling of the mind's clarity.

## Effects on Spiritual Practice

During lunar eclipses:

1. **Meditation intensity increases** - The mind becomes more receptive
2. **Karmic patterns surface** - Hidden tendencies come to light
3. **Spiritual breakthroughs** become more possible

## Practical Guidance

> "Observe silence during eclipse hours to internalize the cosmic energies."

For spiritual seekers, this is an ideal time for:
- Japa meditation
- Self-reflection
- Charitable acts
